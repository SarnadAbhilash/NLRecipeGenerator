# NLPRecipeGenerator

We live in an era of food waste and with rising costs of goods, many people are interested in ways they can save on grocery spending.Â 

We propose an AI solution that can take as input a list of groceries and then generate a recipe.

The intended use would be for someone to input a list of leftover groceries and then be provided with a recipe that is cookable. 

We used the Recipe Box dataset which consists of approximately 125,000 recipes scraped from food websites.

Each recipe is multi-structured, each providing additional information about the recipe.

Our dataset and model can be downloaded via the following link: https://duke.box.com/s/4qocidbzfxhuzl9nyaw5mhxm0p4vzko9
